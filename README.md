# Home Temperature Monitor

## Overview

The **Home Temperature Monitor** is an Arduino-based system designed to provide real-time monitoring of indoor environmental parameters. This project measures **temperature** and **humidity**, displays the data on an LCD screen, and calculates a **Comfort Index** to give insights into the overall indoor climate quality. The system aims to help homeowners maintain a comfortable and healthy indoor environment while improving energy efficiency.


## Problem Statement

Maintaining a comfortable and healthy indoor climate is essential for well-being. However, real-time monitoring of key environmental factors like **temperature** and **humidity** can be challenging. Sudden changes in these parameters can impact health, energy consumption, and overall comfort. Additionally, the **relationship between temperature and humidity**—often expressed as a "Comfort Index"—is frequently overlooked, leaving homeowners unaware of their indoor climate quality.


## Solution

The **Home Temperature Monitor** addresses these challenges by:

- **Measuring temperature and humidity** using a DHT sensor.
- **Displaying real-time data** on an LCD screen for easy access.
- **Calculating the Comfort Index**, a metric that combines temperature and humidity to evaluate overall climate comfort.
- Featuring a **user-friendly interface** with mode-switching functionality (temperature, humidity, or Comfort Index view) controlled by a single button.
- Utilizing a **multi-board architecture** for efficient data processing and communication between components.


## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Accurately tracks temperature and humidity indoors.
- **Comfort Index Calculation**: Provides insights into the overall indoor climate quality.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-read LCD display with a mode-switching button for quick data access.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Helps optimize heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems by providing accurate environmental data.
- **Compact Design**: Multi-board architecture ensures efficient data flow and space-saving implementation.
